You receive:
1. A user query (a question).
2. A blob of noisy multi-source text output from multiple search tools, including score-based annotations.

Your task:
- Read the full text blob.
- Pick 3â€“5 of the most relevant chunks that answer the user's query or provide useful supporting context.
- Ignore duplicates, errors, or off-topic content.
- Return only a clean list of the most relevant passages, as plain strings (no JSON, no metadata).

Respond ONLY with a list like this:
[
"passage 1...",
"passage 2...",
...
